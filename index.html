          I am a Dallas, TX based web developer with over 10 years of experience
          working on projects ranging from large corporate websites and
          single-page web apps to internal productivity tools and online
          storefronts for small businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have extensive front-end development expertise in HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript. I am also quite capable working my way around back-end
          logic and database administration with C#, PHP, and SQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've successfully seen numerous projects through the entire software
          development life cycle.

            Most of my professional work is proprietary or under NDA. However, I
            am always learning and exploring unique ways to implement new
            frameworks or technologies into personal or private client
            applications. Any projects or code I can share for my portfolio, I
            will do so here.

          <h2><i class="fas fa-project-diagram"></i> Generative Block Game</h2>
          <p class="project-description">
            This is a generative Game Boy x Tetris style project I coded with
            p5.js to sharpen my JavaScript skills. The canvas and all internal
            elements are rendered with JavaScript. Each block drop sequence is
            randomly generated (shapes, colors and positioning). I also
            implemented more advanced techniques such as collision detection.
            Once a block reaches the top of the screen container, the logic
            determines the game is now over, clears the screen and all
            variables, displays the game over text for 5 seconds and then loops.
            It's not intended to be playable; just fun to watch.

              On load, my JavaScript code randomly
              selects a color palette between 1-10 colors and assigns that palette to the
              project. Then the code generates a set number of squares using the
              chosen colors and cycles through a predetermined collection of patterns at random. The experience should be (mostly) responsive. Occasionaly it needs to be force refreshed for window size calculations. Pressing the "<i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i>" button below forces a resize and recalculation; it also picks a new random color palette. This project is best experienced full screen and on a desktop.

              <p>This project again is mostly javascript and p5.js (I know, I know). It's a game of chance. The user can fill out the text boxes with any names they want, or none. Clicking the start button, creates a canvas with 10 "ants" and starts the game. Each ant is assigned a random name from the inputs. As the ants traverse the canvas, they leave a trail behind them and have a 50/50 chance of survival when colliding with another. There is some logic to make the ants move randomly most of the time but at intervals, they charge towards each other. The last ant standing is declared the winner. Users can click the share button to copy a unique URL with querystring to their clipboard which when followed will autopopulate a battle with the names from the input fields.<span class="github-link"
